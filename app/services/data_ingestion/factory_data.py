Sometimes I don't know how to explain the reasons to my team so I just tell them that this was not my idea, they share my frustration which builds some weird sense of a team spirit. there are exceptions of course, but in general this is not a great idea to disobey or question the decisions - I know one employee who did that and the director has been limiting his promotions for 3 years. the sense of hierarchy is so strong that when we have a visit from directors nobody even talks.

It's one thing to support causes and values that align. It's another to seemingly push one political decision or voting one way or the other. I also don't think there should be any religious affiliations or ERGs because I could see it leading to greater exclusion and uncomfortable working environments unlike other ERGs. ERGs make sense for things you are, not things you choose, and religion can be a really tricky and easily exclusionary place regardless of the faith or belief system.

The recruiting hiring process is the only major pain point I can think of that makes people not feel included. Anecdotally, I've applied for roles and never heard back from HR & I found out I didn't get the job after HR announced the new hire. And HR had no answers for me when I've asked why they didn't send me a rejection letter - and i'm certainly not alone in that sentiment. So I'd love for HR recruiting to stop used canned responses that say 'we are very busy and can't respond to every message' as that's a horrible tone for HR to set, it makes me feel worthless as an employee   On the same hand, I'd like to see HR Leadership make it more vocal that HR will help & wont' fire females for voicing concerns about sexual harassment. I know too many coworkers that haven't notified HR of harassment out of fear that HR would either fire them for reporting an issue or make it impossible for the harassed person to get a promotion. That's indicative of how little faith so many of my coworkers have in HR's ability to 'help' employees. So, a focus on DE&I is amazing and very much needed. But I want Shipt to stop ignoring that our company has a lot of work to do with out HR internal hiring process.

It also feels invasive to have our weekly team stats posted for a lot of other people to see. I would like our team channel to be a safe, tight knit, and instructional space. Right now, it feels like it's just 4 or 5 people, who aren't all even on my team, making inside jokes.", "Take a more firm stance against members who go against the people first policy with Shipt and not provide the service to them if they violate those views because it is hard to watch the company brush off casual racism against shoppers and HQ employees made by members. There have been several times where reports of blatant racism occurs and the company refuses to terminate the member's service because of money. This really shatters the whole idea of being a people first company when the experience team or shopper has to keep the interests of racist members in mind over their own. It is a mentally damaging experience for anyone involved and I see it on a daily basis where the member always gets their way or receives compensation.", "It seems leadership, people leaders, and those most diverse assume the entirety of Shipt team members agree upon the same viewpoints; whether that be political, regarding LGBTQAI+, religion, etc. We pride ourselves on pursuing an all-inclusive and diverse culture with differing beliefs and viewpoints, but allow team members to publicly silence the voices of unpopular and conservative opinions in slack and listening sessions. People leaders and other team members are able to post in public and private slack channels and threads, pushing all who are present to vote for a particular cause or “call their legislative leaders” to fight for a cause that not all may agree with. It’s assumed and even expected that you agree. We hold listening sessions where moderators and attendees are in favor of “one side” or in the majority, causing immediate division, hostility, and conservative minority voices to feel they have to be silent or fear retaliation, verbal retribution, or being 'canceled.' The way our culture, industry, and major corporations are trending, there is freedom of expression, but only in favor of one idea, and those differing from popular demand are being fired for what is said on social media or external platforms (emphasis on external platforms). I'm concerned Shipt is moving in this direction. I think Shipt should not allow private slack channels unless approved by HR, as these are a breeding ground for hate, inappropriate behavior, discrimination, bias conversations. I also believe that Shipt should immediately implement slack guidelines for public posts in #general, #bhm, #sf, and other company-wide channels. In conversations with other team members, there should be no assumption that all team members hold liberal or secular beliefs.
