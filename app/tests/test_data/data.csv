N/A,,Taking care of their employees and not requiring the salaried managers to work excessive amounts of overtime and not get paid for it due to the lack of staffing at different locations. Due to the lack of staffing at my current location the week of 12/28 to 12/31 was a 4 day work week. We are on mandatory overtime to keep up with the work load due to not having enough techs and I worked 45 hours in 4 days. I am generally at work 55 to 60 hours a week as a salaried employee.,,Due to being cut to the minimum on staffing there is no back up if anyone is to get sick. The people that are making these decisions are not going to the branches to see how it is affecting the employees and they do not like the constructive feed back from the people that are affected and talking to customers every day. My pay was cut for 6 weeks and during that time we bought 36 people in the building lunch for tech appreciation day and ordered 12 new I-pads for ANVL and that is all they are for. Company continues to work salaried employees way more hours than they get paid for and they do not seem to care. ,BU_1,Line_1,Tenure_5,Type_1,Role_3,Country_1,State_24,Location_210,Gender_2,Ethnicity_6,Transformation_2,,OHIPart_1,complete,33,33
